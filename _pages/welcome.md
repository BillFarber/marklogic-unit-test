# ML Unit Test

## What is ML Unit Test
ML Unit Test is a testing component that was originally part of the Roxy project. This component enables you to build 
unit tests that are written in and can test against both XQuery and Server-side JavaScript. Unit testing provides 
several benefits:

- Good tests give you confidence that your code does what you think it does
- Tests show other developers how you expect your code will be used.
- Testing ensures that new code does not reintroduce old bugs
- Unit tests allow you to easily automate the tedious job of careful testing

marklogic-unit-test includes the original Roxy unit test framework for MarkLogic and provides a few new features:

1. A REST endpoint for listing and running unit tests
1. A small Java library for integrating MarkLogic unit tests into existing test frameworks like JUnit
1. The ability to depend on this module as a true third-party dependency via ml-gradle

## How Do I get Started?

To try this out locally, check out the ml-gradle example project. You can use that project's build.gradle file as an 
example of how to use marklogic-unit-test in your own project.
