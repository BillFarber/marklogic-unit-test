# Writing Good Tests

## Purpose of Tests
*TODO*
- demostrate that a feature works
- prevent regressions

## Scope of a Test Suite
*TODO*
(focused on a single library module, or more narrow)

## Scope of a Test Case
*TODO*
(focused on a particular function; you may have multiple cases for the same function)

## Comments in a Test Case
*TODO*
(have a top-level comment for each test case that explains why it's there)

## Using Application Code to Verify Application Code
*TODO*
(test calls an app function; should you use another app function as part of verifying that it worked?)
